 HTML and JS project for looping youtube videos. Although YouTube already has a loop function, this is a fun project to learn javascript and Regular Expressions to parse the user input urls. 
 
 Uses IFrame Player API to request YouTube embedded video with parameters that allow users to listen to any video on repeat.
